# container-init

Embedded Ansible to run in linux minimal environment (just kernel).

## purpose

Main usages are little containers or embedded systems for entrypoints which requires fast
interactions to start process.

Advantages over alpine/bash:

- More security (choose your favour)
- Declarative over bash imperative language.
